#Hey you want ot play something new
here is a game or more specifically the pig game
after applying some simple html and CSS I applied javascript to my game
Here are some rules before you start playing:-
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.  
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.  
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
Hopefully you have read all the instructions
